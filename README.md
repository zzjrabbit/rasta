# rasta(WIP): An array of projects to implement UAST

These projects include: rasta(The main project: UAST definition), rasta-llvm(A LLVM backend, not started yet), rasta-verilog(A To-Verilog backend, uncompleted)

I will add an interpreter in the future.

Above all, you can use rasta to develope a language without lots of work.But I'm really busy, so I hope there would be a warm-hearted guy developes some part of it.
